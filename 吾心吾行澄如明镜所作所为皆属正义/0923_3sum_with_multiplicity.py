"""
Given an integer array A, and an integer target, return the number of tuples i, j, k  such that i < j < k and A[i] + A[j] + A[k] == target.
As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: A = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5], target = 8
Output: 20
Explanation: 
Enumerating by the values (A[i], A[j], A[k]):
(1, 2, 5) occurs 8 times;
(1, 3, 4) occurs 8 times;
(2, 2, 4) occurs 2 times;
(2, 3, 3) occurs 2 times.

Example 2:
Input: A = [1,1,2,2,2,2], target = 5
Output: 12
Explanation: 
A[i] = 1, A[j] = A[k] = 2 occurs 12 times:
We choose one 1 from [1,1] in 2 ways,
and two 2s from [2,2,2,2] in 6 ways.

Note:
1.  3 <= A.length <= 3000
2.  0 <= A[i] <= 100
3.  0 <= target <= 300
